# Venatus Front-end Coding Test

Create a simple snake game using react - there are 100's of youtube videos, loads of code snippets and tutorials if you get stuck or need a quick refresh.

This exercise should not take longer than 1-2 hours to complete.

* You should use TypeScript and React to complete this exercise.
* You should include some units tests using a framework of your choices. 2-3 meaninful tests are fine.
* It is expected to include package.json with 'scripts' to run (locally), lint, test etc.
* The game should be playable using both keys on the keyboard and clickable buttons in the game interface.
* When a player dies, there should be an option to replay their failure, showing how the snake got longer before finally ending.

* Bonus features :-
  * Pick a rate of gameplay
  * Scale the canvas to width of page and hook-into resizing
  * Creative flair - look and feel of the game / UI.
  * Tracking the score
  
Your code should be clean, self documenting and easy to read. Think about variable names, maintainability etc.
